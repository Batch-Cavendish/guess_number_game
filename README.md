# About Project

This is a very simple number guessing game written entirely in C, suitable for C language beginners to learn and for children aged 8-14 to enjoy.

The terminal screen clearing function in the program uses Windows-based system commands, therefore the game can only be compiled and run on Windows, or it can be slightly modified to run on other operating systems.
